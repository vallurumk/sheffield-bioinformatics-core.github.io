People conducting Bioinformatics analysis for research whether they are performing an RNA-seq analysis or creating a bespoke analysis pipeline need skills that academic training might not provide. 

The SBCâ€™s aspiration is that all researchers who need these skills should be given the opportunity to learn them, either from the SBC Team, our University of Sheffield colleagues or other sources. **Our courses are available to researchers outside the University of Sheffield, and online attendance is usually available**.

If you take one of our courses, you will have an experience and qualified trainer leading the teaching. We take our commitment to training seriously and ensuring that it meets best-practice guidelines. SBC members Mark, Emily and Lewis have all been attended and passed the "train the trainer" instructor training offered by [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/index.html) and have FHEA status through [AdvanceHE](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/).

We appreciate the support of PhD student demonstrators during our workshops. If you have experience of a relevant computational / Bioinformatics technique and would like to get involved please [get in touch](/contact). Your time can be compensated and it will count towards your personal development.

At the moment our workshops have online (via google meets) and in-person attendance options available. If you chose to attend online you will have access to main instructor's screen online. There will be demonstrators online to assist if you have any issues. The online option will still be available if you sign-up to attend in-person, but cannot make the session for some reason. Recordings are made available to all course attendees

We can produce attendance certificates if these are required to meet funding requirements, but these are not produced automatically. Please get in touch if you require a certificate.

Our current teaching format is to run shorter sessions split over multiple days. This is to allow participants time to review the materials in-between sessions.

#### Previous training

A record of all of our training workshops can be found on our [events](/events) page.

### IT Services Training

Our colleagues in [IT Services](https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) offer a range of [free training courses](https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/research-training/) for staff and students at The University of Sheffield. This is a good place to look if you want to learn how to generic computational skills such as command-line, High-Performance Computing, other languages that we do not currently cover such as Python or Matlab.

### Statement on charging for courses

Our courses currently have a registration fee in-line with other providers of Bioinformatics training. We try and keep these fees as low as possible to make them affordable. Researchers at TuOS can pay via a grant code or cost centre where possible. We recommend that students ask their supervisors or department for a code that can be used to pay for the course rather than paying themselves.
