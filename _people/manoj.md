## Biography

I obtained my PhD in Molecular Biology at The University of Sheffield where I developed a keen interest in functional genomics and bioinformatics. I pursue this interest at [Kidney Genetics Group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/smph/people/clinical-medicine/albert-cm-ong) where I am currently a [KRUK Postdoctoral Research Associate](https://www.kidneyresearchuk.org/2022/06/24/pkd-research-project-grant-for-professor-albert-ong/).  In addition to my research activities, I dedicate myself to teaching modules MED6003 and 6071 within the MSc Molecular Medicine program.
