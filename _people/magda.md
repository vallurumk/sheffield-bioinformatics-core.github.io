2016 – 2021: PhD (Molecular and Computational Biology) the University of Sheffield.

2012 – 2016: MBiolSci (Biochemistry and Genetics) the University of Sheffield. 

## Biography

Before starting as a Bioinformatics Developer at the Bioinformatics Core within the University of Sheffield, I have completed my integrated Bachelors and Masters degree in Biochemistry and Genetics. This degree was then followed by a PhD in Molecualr and Computational Biology within Dr [Ian Sudbery](https://www.sudlab.co.uk/team-1/ian-sudbery)'s and Dr [Stuart Casson](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/biosciences/people/mbb-staff/academic/stuart-casson)'s group, working on light regulation of gene expression and inter-tissue signaling in A. thaliana. The project aimed to examine how light signals regulate genes at the tissue level to determine whole organism responses in plants. Using the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana and specific transgenic lines developed in the Casson laboratory, this project used next generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis to interrogate light-dependent gene regulation at the tissue specific level. The project examined both public gene expression datasets, as well as generated novel data sets to identify tissue specific regulatory networks.
