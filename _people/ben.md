## Biography

Currently, I am a PhD student with David C James exploring omics analyses of mammalian cell factories currently used in the biopharmaceutical industry (Lonza Biologics). Specifically, I use alternative splicing-based analyses to expand the design space for cell engineering. I also help teach specialised bioinformatics courses and general R courses with Mark J Dunning at the Sheffield Bioinformatics Core. Beyond my research, I also assist supervision of BioEng/ChemEng MSc research projects with Adam Brown.
