## Biography

I joined the Sheffield Bioinformatics Core in October 2023 after completing a position as a laboratory informatics systems (LIMS) manager at the CVR-CRUSH (COVID-19 Drug-Screening and Resistance Hub), University of Glasgow. Prior to this position, I was a bioinformatics scientific advisor (CTO) for commercial entities named the Gene Box and SpeedGaze technologies solution Pvt Ltd. (Mumbai). I completed two postdoctoral fellowship at the Dell Medical Center – UT Austin, Texas, USA and Vancouver Prostate Center - Canada before taking up a position as a visiting faculty for bioinformatics at the University of Mumbai and Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay. Earlier to this position, I was a Marie Curie early-stage researcher (PhD.) at the Charite University Berlin and Mosaiques Diagnositics GmBH - Germany in a bladder cancer project entitled Bladder Cancer Molecular Medicine (BCMolMed). The project emphasized on a multidisciplinary approach in discovering bladder cancer biomarkers and included biotech industries, universities, and academic research centers across the European Union and North America. 

In the Mitacs Elevate/BCMolMed fellowships, my tasks involved the bioinformatics modelling of genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics changes in bladder cancer invasion patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. I am proficient in using statistical software R-bioconductor, bio-python
packages and network modelling tools from Cytoscape to integrate protein-interaction networks, gene-regulatory data and pathway enrichment databases for defining relevant biological processes in bladder cancer invasion. In addition, I have also used large scale public databases like TCGA, AACR GENIE, CPTAC, ProteomeXchange, GEO, SRA-EBI and ENCODE in order to download, analyse and validate bladder, prostate, breast and colorectal cancer data. I have experience in handling and analyzing omics data sets from DNA/RNA sequencing (including CNV), gene expression microarrays, single-cell RNA-seq and mass-spectrometry profiles. My research as a cancer bioinformatician at the Sheffield University is to integrate -omics techniques with tissue imaging by using machine-learning and deep-neural networks algorithms to predict resistance to therapy in diseased patients and distinguish drug-responsive patients based on gene regulatory networks. In order to assimilate this knowledge, I had opportunities to attend courses, workshops and conferences held by EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany, and Marie-Curie training programs within the last years.
