## Biography

I obtained my PhD in the Bone Oncology group of <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/medicine/people/oncology-metabolism/ingunn-holen" target="_blank">Prof. Ingunn Holen</a> and <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/medicine/people/oncology-metabolism/penelope-d-ottewell" target="_blank">Dr Penelope Ottewell</a> in the Department of Oncology & Metabolism at The University of Sheffield Medical School. My PhD project focussed on developing novel models of mitotic quiescence in human breast cancer cells *in vitro* and metastatic dormancy *in vivo*. My early postdoctoral work was focussed on characterising the cellular sub-populations isolated from these models using a multitude of approaches, including next-generation sequencing. During 2019, I undertook a three-month training placement in high-performance computing (HPC) and bioinformatic analysis of RNA-Seq data at the <a href="https://www.garvan.org.au/research/kinghorn-centre-for-clinical-genomics" target="_blank">Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics</a> at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Sydney, Australia working under <a href="https://www.garvan.org.au/about-us/people/nenbar" target="_blank">Dr Nenad Bartonicek</a>. Upon my return to The University of Sheffield, I transitioned to a two-year position as a postdoctoral cancer bioinformatician and in June 2022 moved to the role of cancer bioinformatician embedded within the Sheffield Bioinformatics Core Facility and working in the groups of <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/medicine/people/oncology-metabolism/james-catto" target="_blank">Prof. James Catto</a> and <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/medicine/people/neuroscience/dennis-wang" target="_blank">Dr Dennis Wang</a>. I was appointed as Senior Lecturer in Data Science and Analytics in the Department of Computing, Sheffield Hallam University in May 2023 and awarded a 3 year Honorary Senior Lectureship in the University of Sheffield Medical School at the same time.

My current research activity includes two Genomics England 100,000 project studies aiming to create a mutational map in bladder and low-grade serous ovarian cancers, provision of bioinformatics support to the Genotype of Urothelial Cancer - Stratified Treatment and Oncological outcomes (GUSTO) phase II clinical trial, a project aiming to develop a test for prediction of response to chemotherapy in gestational trophoblastic disease, and a project continuing my early post-doctoral work which aim to identify molecular drivers and biomarkers of metastatic dormancy in breast cancer. I am also involved in several smaller clinical and pure research projects in a range of areas including high-throughput screening, public healthcare data analytics, and predictive modelling of prognostic risk factors in a range of settings.
