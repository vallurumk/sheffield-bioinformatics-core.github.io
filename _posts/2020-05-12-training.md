# Index of training resources

With labs closed at the current time due to Coronavirus, many are using this time to brush up on their data analysis and Bioinformatics skills. At SBC, we have a program of face-to-face training events and make the materials available [on here](training/).

However, their are some topics that we do not currently provide training for, and plenty of materials available in video form. We have therefore created an index of other training resources that we have found useful ourselves.

This includes the excellent recent "Lockdown learning" series from [Simon Cockell](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/bsu/staff/simoncockellnclacuk.html#background) and the [Babraham Bioinformatics](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/) bitesize series. Also included are materials developed during my previous role at Cancer Research Uk Cambridge Institute.
