# Bioinformatics Clinics held at Sheffield University

The Sheffield Bioinformatics Core team are currently holding coding clinics available every fortnight on Mondays at 2pm and 3pm. The clinics are available for **all University of Sheffield researchers and students** to get help and support with bioinformatics and data analysis problems. At each session members of the Sheffield Bioinformatic Core will be available to offer help and advice.

## We can help with:
- Coding issues and improvements
- Submitting jobs on the HPC
- Data visualisation
- Experimental design
- Help with accessing large data

Here's what some of our previous attendees thought about the clinics:

> *Not only helped with my issues on a number of occasions but have also ensured that I've understood how to fix the problem. I can't describe how helpful the clinic has been to my research!!!*

> *Invaluable service. I worked 2 days on correcting error codes for a filtering package to no avail. 30 minutes into a clinic, we had solved the error together*

> *The issue I needed addressing was resolved. Nobody in my group had the expertise to do this. The clinic allowed me to be able to continue analysing my data.*
