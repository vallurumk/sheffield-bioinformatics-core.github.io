The Sheffield Bioinformatics Core offers in- depth bioinformatic analysis of single cell RNA sequencing datasets. This exciting area of analysis allows us to identify and measure heterogeneity within populations of cells and further mine subpopulations for differentially expressed cell marker genes and enriched pathways.

Our custom analysis can include:

- Quality control 
- Subsetting and filtering
- Clustering of cellular subpopulations
- Integration of differing datasets
- Defining differentially-expressed cell type markers
- Pathways analysis
- Complex visualisations.

We have recently contributed our single cell analysis to two exciting publications. The first characterised the zebrafish endogenous retrovirus, zferv, and hypothesised about its role in immunity and brain development [1]. In this study we were able to integrate previously published datasets to compare expression of zferv1a across haematopoietic lineages. 

In the second, the JAG1-NOTCH4 pathway was examined in its role in atherosclerosis [2]. Sub- clustering of single cell rna-seq data from murine heart cells were able to show that JAG1 expression suppresses endothelial subsets with roles in vascular repair.

As the field of single cell transcriptomics progresses, demand for high quality analysis and collaboration increases. [Please get in touch](https://sbc.shef.ac.uk/contact/) with the SBC to chat about your single cell analysis - **especially if you are preparing a grant application that will require Bioinformatics support**.


We are also planning some training workshops on the analysis of single-cell (10X) data. Please see our [training page](https://sbc.shef.ac.uk/training/) for updates.
