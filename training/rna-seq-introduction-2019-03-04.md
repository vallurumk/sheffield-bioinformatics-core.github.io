description: "High-throughput RNA-sequencing is now the standard technique for quantifying transcript abundance in a biological sample of interest. In this course we will describe the processes that take place once you submit a library for RNA sequencing, and what data you should expect to receive from the Bioinformatics Core. We will describe the steps involved to go from sequencing library to a list of genes that show statistically significant differences between your biological conditions of interest. Practical sessions will use the user-friendly Galaxy interface (https://usegalaxy.org/) to demonstrate tasks such as alignment, quality control and assessing differential expression. We will also showcase some web sites you can use for enrichment and pathways analysis."

## Overview

**Please note that we will provide some pre-recording lecture material (around 1.5 hours) for you to watch before the workshop**. The workshop itself will be *hands-on*; working through exercises and watching demonstrations from the lecturers.

High-throughput RNA-sequencing is now the standard technique for quantifying transcript abundance in a biological sample of interest. In this course we will describe the processes that take place once you submit a library for RNA sequencing, and what data you should expect to receive from the Bioinformatics Core.

We will describe the steps involved to go from sequencing library to a list of genes that show statistically significant differences between your biological conditions of interest. Practical sessions will use the user-friendly Galaxy interface (https://usegalaxy.org/) to demonstrate tasks such as *alignment*, *quality control* and *assessing differential expression*. We will also showcase some web sites you can use for enrichment and pathways analysis.

*Please note that the course will not cover the analysis of RNA-seq data using the  R programming langugage*

## Who should attend this course?

Researchers in life sciences who want to get an appreciation for the computational steps involved in RNA-seq analysis, but not neccesarily wishing to execute the pipeline for themselves. 

## Objectives:- After this course you should be able to:

- Appreciate some of the issues that can arise when designing an RNA-seq experiment 
- Recall the key pipeline steps in an RNA-seq analysis
- Understand the contents of fastq and bam file format for RNA-seq data
- Perform a gene set enrichment analysis using available online tools

## Aims:- During this course you will learn about:

- Basic principles of Experimental design for RNA-seq experiments
- The steps in a best-practice pipeline for RNA-seq analysis
- The theory behind popular methods for pathways and gene set enrichment analysis
- Executing basic Bioinformatics tools using Galaxy
