## Overview

This course offers an introduction to working with Linux. We will describe the Linux environment so that participants can start to utilize command-line tools and feel comfortable using a text-based way of interacting with a computer. We give example of processing data arising from Next-Generation Sequencing experiments, in particular an RNA-seq experiment.

**This course is highly-recommended as a pre-requisite for our course RNA-seq Analysis in R**

## Who should attend this course?

Those wanting to use the command-line to perform data analysis; particularly those with next-generation sequencing data such as RNA-Seq

## Objectives:- After this course you should be able to:

- Connect to a Unix / Linux system
- Manipulate files and directories within the Linux system
- Work with text files
- Understand how to structure and write a simple shell script
- Run programs from the command-line

## Aims:- During this course you will learn about:

- Navigating through a Unix file system
- Creating and deleting files
- Searching for files and for text within a file
- Writing and executing simple shell scripts


## Prerequisites

- No prior programming experience is required

## Software

- No software is required. You will be given access to an AWS machine on the day

## Instructors

- Mark Dunning, Bioinformatics Core Director
- Katjusa Koler, PhD Student
- Emily Chambers, Bioinformatics Core Analyst
