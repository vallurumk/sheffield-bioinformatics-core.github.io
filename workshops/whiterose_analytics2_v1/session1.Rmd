# Workshop Overview

High-throughput sequencing is now established as a standard technique for many functional genomics studies; allowing the researcher to compare and contrast the transcriptomes of many individuals to obtain biological insight. A high-volume of data are generated from these experimental techniques and thus require robust and reproducible tools to be employed in the analysis.

In this workshop, you will be learning how to analyse RNA-seq count data, using R. This will include reading the data into R, quality control and performing differential expression analysis and gene set testing, with a focus on the well-respected DESEq2 analysis workflow. You will learn how to generate common plots for analysis and visualisation of gene expression data, such as boxplots and heatmaps. 

Although we will use RNA-seq data as a case study, the format of the data and methodologies will be highly applicable to other types of high-throughput omics data.

# Introduction

Measuring gene expression on a genome-wide scale has become common practice over the last two decades or so, with microarrays predominantly used pre-2008. With the advent of next generation sequencing technology in 2008, an increasing number of scientists use this technology to measure and understand changes in gene expression in often complex systems. As sequencing costs have decreased, using RNA-Seq to simultaneously measure the expression of tens of thousands of genes for multiple samples has never been easier. The cost of these experiments has now moved from generating the data to storing and analysing it.

There are many steps involved in analysing an RNA-Seq experiment.

Analysing an RNAseq experiment begins with sequencing reads. Traditionally, these are aligned to a reference genome, then the number of reads mapped to each gene can be counted. More modern approaches such as `salmon` quantify transcripts directly and do not require genome alignment to have taken place. Either approach results in a table of counts, which is what we perform statistical analyses on in R. While mapping and counting are important and necessary tasks, they are typically performed in languages other than R and so outside the scope of this course.

<div class="information">
If you want to know more about genome alignment and command-line tools, feel free to check out our workshop on this topic in your own time

[https://sbc.shef.ac.uk/training/command-line-2020-02-12/](https://sbc.shef.ac.uk/training/command-line-2020-02-12/)
</div>

In these sessions will be starting from the count data and getting straight into the analysis.

We will be following a workflow that uses the `DESeq2` package. An alternative and well-respected workflow is based on the [edgeR and limma packages](https://bioconductor.github.io/BiocWorkshops/rna-seq-analysis-is-easy-as-1-2-3-with-limma-glimma-and-edger.html).

### Mouse mammary gland dataset

The data for this tutorial comes from a Nature Cell Biology paper, [*EGF-mediated induction of Mcl-1 at the switch to lactation is essential for alveolar cell survival*](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25730472). 

This study examines the expression profiles of basal stem-cell enriched cells (B) and committed luminal cells (L) in the mammary gland of virgin, pregnant and lactating mice. Six groups are present, with one for each combination of cell type and mouse status. Each group contains two biological replicates.

The sequencing reads for this experiment were uploaded to the [Sequencing Read Archive (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP045534) and processed using `salmon`. However, the workflow we will describe can be applied to other sources of count data.

# Obtaining the metadata

We refer to *metadata* as the data that describes the biological and technical characteristics of the samples we have sequenced. Examples of variables recorded in the metadata might include.

- tumour / normal status
- cell line
- age
- gender
- date of collection
- litter

We include the sample groups that we want to compare, and any potential *confounding factors* that we might need to address as part of our quality assessment. The metadata is stored in a spreadsheet and typically entered by-hand. When creating such data we should be mindful of some best-practice guidelines that will make our data easier to read into R.

<div class="information">
See here for a round-up of common errors to be avoiding when creating spreadsheets
[Data Carpentry lesson on spreadsheet errors](https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/02-common-mistakes/index.html)
</div>

The `sampleInfo.txt` in the `meta_data` folder contains basic information about the samples that we will need for the analysis today. This includes the ID for the sample from SRA, an ID assigned by the researcher, and the cell type and developmental stage for each sample.

```{r loadSampleInfo}
# Read the sample information into R
sampleinfo <- read.delim("meta_data/sampleInfo.txt")
View(sampleinfo)
rownames(sampleinfo) <- sampleinfo$run
sampleinfo
```



# Reading in the count data

Eventually we will be using the DESeq2 Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis. The precise method of importing your count data into DESeq2 depends on the workflow used to generate the counts. The [DESeq2 vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#input-data) gives many different use-cases. For instance, if you have your counts in a single file (e.g. if following our Galaxy tutorials) you can follow [this example](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#countmat)

### Overview

We are going to use the [`tximport`](http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.7563.1) package to import our count data into R and collapse the data to the *gene level*. This requires us to run a function in the following form:-

```{r eval=FALSE}
txi <- tximport(files=..., type="salmon", tx2gene=...)
```

So we will need to define the files that we want to import and a transcript mapping data frame. The transcript mapping takes the form:-

```
 | TXNAME | GENEID
1| ENST00000456328.2 |  ENSG00000223972.5
2| ENST00000450305.2 | ENSG00000223972.5
3| ENST00000473358.1 | ENSG00000243485.5
4| ENST00000469289.1 | ENSG00000243485.5
5| ENST00000607096.1 | ENSG00000284332.1
6| ENST00000606857.1 | ENSG00000268020.3
```

`tximport` is able to import counts produced by different software, and different workflows are described for each in the [tximport vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/tximport/inst/doc/tximport.html).

## Identifying the files

The samples from this study have been *quantified* using `salmon`, which is beyond the scope of this workshop. Note that the salmon analysis produced many other files (e.g. log files), but we will only need the `quant.sf.gz` files for analysis.

The function we are going to use to import the salmon files requires a `vector` comprising the paths to the files that are to be imported. To construct such a vector we can use the following code chunk. We can name each item in the vector according to the directory name. These names will be used eventually to name the columns of our count matrices.

```{r}
dirs <- list.files("salmon_quant/")
quant_files <- list.files("salmon_quant/",pattern="quant.sf.gz",recursive = TRUE,full.names = TRUE)
names(quant_files) <- dirs
quant_files
```

### Inspecting the salmon output

The quant files are simple tab-delimited files that tabulate the counting results for each *transcript* in our chosen organism. Although we will use a specialised Bioconductor package (`tximport`) to import the counts for entire dataset into R, we can inspect the first of the files using the standard `read_tsv` function from the `readr` package.


```{r}
library(readr)
quants <- read_tsv(quant_files[1])
head(quants)
dim(quants)
```

Our differential expression analysis will be carried-out at the *gene-level*, so we need to perform an additional level of summarisation before we can proceed. Effectively we need to sum the counts for all exons that belong to each gene. The *mappings* from transcript to genes can be obtained by a pre-built database (such as Ensembl). We have provided such data in a csv file that we can read in. See the Appendix if you want to know the details

The `tx2gene.csv` file was missing from early version of the course data zip. If missing you can download it [from here](tx2gene.csv)

```{r}
tx2gene <- read_csv("tx2gene.csv")
head(tx2gene)
```



We can import our dataset with the `tximport` package. The `ignoreTxVersion` argument needs to be set to `TRUE`; you might have noticed that the transcript names in the quant files have a version number at the end `e.g. .1`, so won't match the transcript names in the `tx2gene` table.

```{r}
library(tximport)
txi <- tximport(quant_files,type="salmon",tx2gene = tx2gene,ignoreTxVersion = TRUE)
```

The resulting object is a "*list*" structure in R which contains a number of components that we can access using a `$` operator

The raw counts can be found using `txi$counts`

```{r}
head(txi$counts)
```




# Quality control of the imported counts

We will be using the `DESeq2` library to analyse this dataset. Along with the counts and metadata, a *design* for the experiment also needs to be specified. This will define how the differential expression analysis is carried out, but can be changed at a later stage so for now we will use `CellType` as our factor of interest.


The object displays in a similar way to the microarray data we looked at in the previous section.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(DESeq2)
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromTximport(txi, 
                                colData = sampleinfo,
                                design <- ~CellType)
dds
```

The object contains all the counts along with the metadata for the experiment

```{r}
head(assay(dds))
```

```{r}
colData(dds)
```


### Visualising library sizes

We can look at a few different plots to check that the data is good quality, and that the samples are behaving as we would expect. First, we can check how many reads we have for each sample in the `DESeqDataSet`. The counts themselves are accessed using the `assay` function; giving a matrix of counts. The sum of a particular column is therefore the total number of reads for that sample.

```{r}
sum(assay(dds)[,1])
```

A convenience function `colSums` exists for calculating the sum of each column in a matrix, returning a `vector` as a result.

```{r dgeLibrarySizes}
colSums(assay(dds))

```


# Exercise

<div class="exercise">
- Use an appropriate function from `dplyr` to add a column containing the number of reads for each sample to the `sampleinfo` data frame.
- Produce a bar plot to show the Millions of reads for each sample
</div>

![](images/lib_size.png)

### Visualising count distributions

We typically use a `boxplot` to visualise difference the distributions of the columns of a numeric data frame. Applying the `boxplot` function to the raw counts from our dataset reveals something about the nature of the data; the distributions are dominated by a few genes with very large counts.

```{r}
boxplot(assay(dds))
```


We can use the `vst` or `rlog` function from `DESeq2`to compensate for the effect of different library sizes and put the data on the log$_2$ scale. The effect is to remove the dependence of the variance on the mean, particularly the high variance of the logarithm of count data when the mean is low. For more details see the [DESeq2 vignette](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#count-data-transformations)



```{r}
# Get log2 counts
vsd <- vst(dds,blind=TRUE)
# Check distributions of samples using boxplots
boxplot(assay(vsd), xlab="", ylab="Log2 counts per million",las=2,main="Normalised Distributions")
# Let's add a blue horizontal line that corresponds to the median logCPM
abline(h=median(assay(vsd)), col="blue")
```



## Principal components Analysis (PCA) 

<div class="information">
See here for a nice explanation of PCA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jp4gsfOLMs
</div>

The [(Principal Components Analysis) PCA](http://setosa.io/ev/principal-component-analysis/) plot, shows the samples in the 2D plane spanned by their first two principal components. A principle components analysis is an example of an unsupervised analysis, where we don’t need to specify the groups. If your experiment is well-controlled and has worked well, what we hope to see is that the greatest sources of variation in the data correspond to the treatments/groups we are interested in. It is also an incredibly useful tool for quality control and checking for outliers.

`DESeq2` has a convenient `plotPCA` function for making the PCA plot, which makes use of the `ggplot2` graphics package.

```{r}
plotPCA(vsd,intgroup="CellType")
```

# Exercise

<div class="exercise">

- Is the `plotPCA` plot based on all genes in the dataset? How can we change how many genes are used for the PCA analysis? Does this significantly change the plot? (HINT: check the documentation for the `plotPCA` function.)
- Change the `intgroup` parameter so that both CellType and Status are used for grouping. (See the documentation again)
- Is there something strange going on with the samples?
- Identify the two samples that don't appear to be in the right place.
- What other problems can you see with the metadata?

</div>

### Note about batch effects

In our unsupervised analysis we should see that the main source of variation is due to biological effects, and not technical variation such as when the libraries were sequenced. If we do observe high technical variation in our data, it is not a complete disaster provided that we have designed our experiment properly. In particular the [sva Bioconductor package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/sva/inst/doc/sva.pdf) can correct for batch effects provided that representatives of the groups of interest appear in each batch. Alternatively, the batch or confounding factor may be incorporated into the differential expression analysis.

### Correcting the sample information

Hopefully we have spotted a potential sample swap in the dataset. The mislabeled samples are MCL1.DH, which is labeled as luminal but should be basal, and MCL1.LA, which is labeled as basal but should be luminal.  Such errors are not uncommon when handling large numbers of samples and sometimes we need to go back to the lab books and verify that a swap has been made. *If there is no supporting evidence for a swap then it can be safer to exclude the samples*. 

Furthermore, the person creating the sample sheet has been inconsistent about the way that values of `CellType` and `Status` have been entered into the metadata. Such errors can be annoying when labeling plots, but have more serious consequences when attempting to fit statistical models to the data.


```{r correctSampleSheet}
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
sampleinfo %>% 
mutate(CellType = str_to_lower(CellType)) %>% 
mutate(Status = str_trim(Status)) %>% 
mutate(CellType = ifelse(Name == "MCL1-DH","basal",CellType)) %>% 
mutate(CellType= ifelse(Name == "MCL1-LA","luminal",CellType)) %>% 
write.table(file="meta_data/sampleInfo_corrected.txt",sep="\t",row.names = FALSE)
```

# Exercise for next time

<div class="exercise">

- Re-create the `DESeqDataset` object to include the corrected sample information
- Re-run the plotPCA function on the new data and verify that the sample groups now look correct
- Make an R notebook to document your analysis
- We used "base R" to make a boxplot of the variance-stabilised counts for convenience. To keep with the tidyverse theme, try to make the plot using `ggplot2`. For the first few steps you will need to make a data frame with an ID column (see below). Then investigate the `tidyr` package to transform the data into a shape that `ggplot2` is happy with.
</div>

```{r}

assay(vsd) %>% 
  data.frame %>% 
  tibble::rownames_to_column("Gene")
```

# Appendix

### Defining the transcript mapping


In order for `tximport` to give *gene-level* counts, we need to supply a data frame that can be used to associate each transcript name with a gene identifier. **It is important to use a transcript file that corresponds to the name genome build as the file used to count the transcripts**. 

We can check if the `gtf` file exists in the directory we expect by running the `file.exists` function; returning `TRUE` or `FALSE`

```{r}
gtf_file <- "Mus_musculus.GRCm38.91.chr.gtf.gz"
file.exists(gtf_file)
```

If required, we can download from the Ensembl FTP site. 


```{r eval=FALSE} 
download.file("ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-91/gtf/mus_musculus/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.91.chr.gtf.gz",destfile = gtf_file)

```


### Note on analysing your own data

![](images/download_gtf.png)

If analysing your own data, you will have to locate the gtf file on the Ensembl FTP site. If you enter `ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-91/gtf` into a web browser you will be able to navigate the site and find your organism of interest. By right-clicking on the name of the gtf you will be able to copy the URL and then paste into RStudio.

```{r eval=FALSE}
gtf_file <- "ensembl_ref/my_ref.gtf"
download.file(PASTE_LINK_FROM_ENSEMBL_HERE,destfile = gtf_file)
```

### Creating a transcript database

The Bioconducor website provides many pre-built transcript databases for some organisms (Human, Mouse, Rat etc)  which provide transcript definitions and allow users to query the locations of particular genes, exons and other genomic features. You may find a pre-built package that already has the transcript locations required to create the transcript mapping file. Check out the annotation section of the Bioconductor website - http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___AnnotationData and look for packages starting `TxDb...`

However, it is quite easy to build such a database if we have a `gtf` file using the `GenomicFeatures` infrastructure.

```{r message=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
## Could take a few minutes to run the makeTxDbFromGFF command
library(GenomicFeatures)
txdb <- makeTxDbFromGFF(gtf_file)
```

The database has a number of predefined "keys" and "columns" that have to be specified when creating a query

```{r,eval=FALSE}
keytypes(txdb)
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
columns(txdb)
```

Sometimes we would want to query the positions for a limited set of selected genes (perhaps the results of a differential-expression analysis), but in this case we want the gene names that correspond to every transcript in the database. To get the names of all transcripts we can use the `keys` function. We then compose the query using the `select` function to return a data frame

```{r,eval=FALSE}
k <- keys(txdb, keytype="TXNAME")
tx_map <- select(txdb, keys = k, columns="GENEID", keytype = "TXNAME")
head(tx_map)
```
