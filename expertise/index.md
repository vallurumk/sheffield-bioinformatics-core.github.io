The SBC has expertise in the following areas, and software packages:-

## Experimental Design

*If you are planning an experiment, please come to us before generating data so that we can discuss the design* 

The Core is experienced in advising on the following issues:-

- Optimal number of replicates
- Biases and confounding factors
- Single-end or paired-end sequencing
- Depth of sequencing required
- Contacts at Sequencing vendors

## Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Analysis

![](../images/example_heatmap.png)
![](../images/example_oncoplot.png)

- BWA, and other aligners for all NGS platforms and applications
- edgeR, DESeq2, STAR and salmon (among others) for RNA-Seq analysis
- GATK, VarScan and MuTect for somatic and germline mutation calling
- MACS2, and other peak callers for ChIP-Seq and ATAC-seq analysis


## Downstream Analysis

![](../images/example_network_analysis.png)

- Downstream analysis of gene lists to identify over-represented pathways / ontologies using [GSEA](http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp), goseq, or other online tools such as [DAVID](https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) or [Genetrail](https://genetrail2.bioinf.uni-sb.de/).

## Single Cell RNA-Seq

![](../images/souilhol_et_al.png)

- QC, analysis and visualisation for single cell RNA-seq data
- Analysis of Spatial transcriptomics data


## Microarray Analysis

![](../images/example_microarray.png)

- Experience with data from Affymetrix and Illumina platforms
- Varying data types, including expression, methylation (450K), SNP and copy-number

## Further Expertise

- Custom visualisation of high-throughput data
- Custom bioinformatic workflows and piplines with [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/)
- Packaging and deploying software environments with [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Data Management and curation
- Creating interactive web applications wih [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)

As well as these analysis services, we also provide [training](https://sbc.shef.ac.uk/training) courses and bespoke 1-to-1 training for researchers
