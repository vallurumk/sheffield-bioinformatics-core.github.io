## Workshop Information

Monday 30th January 09:30 - 16:30
Bartolome House, Seminar Room EG03

This workshop will be *in-person* only. We will run online sessions in the future


***Some basic R knowledge is assumed (and is essential). Without it, you will struggle on this course. If you are not familiar with the R statistical programming language we strongly encourage you to work through an introductory R course before attempting these materials. We recommend reviewing Parts 1 and 2 of our R introductory course before deciding if you can attend***

- [R crash course Part 1](https://sbc.shef.ac.uk/r-online/part1.nb.html)
- [R crash course Part 2](https://sbc.shef.ac.uk/r-online/part2.nb.html)

## Materials



## Overview

Recent advances in gene expression technologies have made it possible to measure transcription for individual cells - enabling researchers to understand cellular heterogeneity and understand complex tissue types.  In this course we describe the analysis of data derived from such experiments using the R language. 

We will focus specifically on data generated using the 10X protocol, although the methods will relevant to other technologies


## Who should attend this course?

Researchers in life sciences who want to get an appreciation for the computational steps involved in Single-cell RNA-seq analysis, and how to execute best-practice RNA-seq workflows in R.

## Objectives:- After this course you should be able to:

- Read data from a 10X experiment into R
- Perform quality assessment on single-cell RNA-seq data
- Execute different clustering methods
- Identify a set of markers to distinguish unique cell clusters


## Aims:- During this course you will learn about:

- The Seurat R package
- What QC metrics are commonly-used for single-cell RNA-seq
- Normalization and integration of single-cell datasets
- The theory behind popular clustering methods for single-cell data


## Software installation


## Instructors

- Dr. Emily Chambers, Bioinformatics Core Scientist
- Dr. Mark Dunning, Bioinformatics Core Director
- Dr. Niamh Errington, Bioinformatics Postdoctural scientist
